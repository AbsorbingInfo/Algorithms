### Quick Find
- int arr of N
- p and q are connected if they have same element
- Union method which connects two point/objects
- Connected method returns boolean if given point/objects are connected

### Analysis
- **Initialize**: O(n)
- **Union**: O(n)
- **find**: O(1)

### Drawback
- Union operation is too expensive
